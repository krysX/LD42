# AMAZED

## Description
A simple dungeon-style maze game where you run out of space.
And Ludum Dare is a jam where I ran out of time. So there's only 1 level in the game.

The goal is to reach the end point(blue). If you touch the lava you die.
You will leave obstacles behind you as you go. So don't be walled in 'cause then you also die.

## Controls/Mechanics
- Use WASD or arrow keys to move - but be careful of your moves.
- Space gives you space - pressing space gives you the ability to clear 5 obstacles - but manage your spaces well 'cause you'll clear any obstacle you collide with (including your own trace)

- You can see your space data in the top right corner.
  - On the right of the slash is how many times you can use the space ablility.
  - On the left side of the slash is the amount of obstacles can you clear at the moment.
  
## Made using
- Unity
- Paint.net
- Ableton Live 9

## Known bugs
- Spawned obstacles are white in some circumstances
- The player is able to break the moving obstacles
- Occasional issues with lava and the end point
