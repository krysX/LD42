# LD42
A simple dungeon-style maze game where you run out of space.
And Ludum Dare is a jam where I ran out of time. So there's only 1 level in the game.

You will leave obstacles behind you.


## Controls/Mechanics
use WASD or arrow keys to move - but be careful- you'll leave obstacles behind you.
Space gives you space - pressing space gives you the ability to clear 5 obstacles - but manage your spaces well 'cause you'll clear any obstacle you collide with (including your own trace))
